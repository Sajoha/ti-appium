# ti-appium

The beginning of an npm module to tie together Titanium and Appium functionality. Now that Appium usage is expanding, we're currently maintaining similar source code across different test suites, some fixes are only implemented in certain suites due to lack of maintenance. Once completed this module will be used as a backbone across all our tests.

Currently under construction üèó
